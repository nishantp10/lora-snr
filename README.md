# lora-snr

This function calculates the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) for the incoming LORA signal FFT.

It takes in complex FFT symbols and returns SNR in db. 

Call this function from the main work program and receive the floating vector.

The rest of the code for LORA demodulation is available at https://github.com/BastilleResearch/gr-lora
